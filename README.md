# sign_recognition_incremental

This repository have the code to train a Sign Language Recognition (SLR) model that use an incremental learning approach.

The SLR model this repository use is called "Spoter" and has been created by -- in this repository --.
If you want to use our implementation, you can use this set of reposiroties.
* Spoter --  (for training the model)
* ConnectingPoints -- (for preparing the dataset)
* Perusil -- (for preprocessing the dataset)

This implementation use three incremental learning techniques.
1. First
2. Second
3. Third
